# Geographical NER and entity linking 

The NER part of the project is in the folder "_ner_", entity linking is in "_el_".

The entity linker script generates large enough files that GitHub does not support upload of them, 
thus only the script files themselves are pushed. To run the _el_ scripts, first generate a knowledge base from `kb.py`, then run `el.py`
